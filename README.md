# Coding Cheatsheets
A repository for coding references and cheatsheets.

This is my personal code reference repo but you are welcome to use it! 

## About the Cheetsheets
I'm always trying to improve the cheatsheets and do my best to keep them up-to-date.

The cheatsheets are located in the **cheatsheets** folder. 

## Available Cheetsheets

- **C#** (work-in-progress)
- **Power Automate** (needs formatting)

### Future Cheatsheets
