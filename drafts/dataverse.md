## Environment - Provision your Dataverse Environment
Dataverse for Teams environment is where all business data, apps and flows are stored. Each environment is associated with a Microsoft Office 365 group for the team. Each team can only have one Dataverse Teams environment. When an app or chatbot is created for the first time into a team, the Dataverse for Teams environment is provisioned automatically. After the environment is created, you can create tables and flows in Dataverse.

## Dataverse Tables

### Columns
Columns are a way to store a discrete piece of information within a record in a table. Columns have types that can store data of a certain type in a field. 

**Data Types** 
These data types are available in Dataverse:

- Text (Single line or multiple line)
- Number (Whole, Decimal, Float, Currency)
- Data and Time (Format, Time zone adjustment, usage guidelines)
- Reference (Lookup, Customer)
  - Lookup: A column that links two tables together in a many-to-one relationship. A lookup column creates a reference to a single row in the related tables.
  - Customer: A lookup column that you can use to specify a customer, which can be either an account or a contact. Adding a lookup table column to a table creates two many-to-one relationships from the table to the account and contact tables.
- Choice (List of options)
  - Global: A global choice is a seperate component and can be reused for multiple columns on multiple tables. The list of choices is shared for the table columns that use the global choice
  - Local: A local choice only exists for the table column
- Yes/No
- File (File, Image)
- Autonumber: automatically generate alphanumeric strings whenever they're created.
- Behaviour:
  - Simple: A column that users can enter data or select an option
  - Calculated: A read-only column whose value is calculated from other column values
  - Rollup: A read-only column that is calculated by aggregating values from table rows and columns in a one-to-many relationship
- Formula (PowerFx): Used to calculate the value for the column. Read-only. 
- System Data Types
  - Unique Identifier: Stores a globablly unique identifier (GUID) value for each row
  - Owner: Single reference to either a team or a user row. All team or user-owned tables have this column
  - PartyList: Allows for multiple references to multiple tables. These lookups are found on the Email table TO and Cc columns and in the Phone and Appointment tables.
  - Regarding: allows for a single lookup reference to multiple tables. These can be found in the regarding column used in activities
  - Status: Generally corrospond to active and inactive status.
  - Status Reason: Has options that provide more detail about the status column. Can be added and edited.
 
### Primary name column
Used to reference the table row with the user interface. Typically stores the name description of the data that is stored in a table's row and is a single line of text column. It is the first column listed so you have a way to identify a record.

Primary name column is not the same as the unique identifier column that is also autogenerated when you create a new custom table. The Primary key column is a GUID.

**Tip** If you want to make the primary name column unique, then create an alternative key and assign the Primary Name clolumn to the new key.
 
**Tip** You can add any combo of columns to a custom or standard table to meet your needs, but you can't delete a standard column from a standard table.  

The number of columns within a table varies between a few columns to a hundred or more. If you require more than a few hundred columns, you might need to consider how you're structuring your data storage.

**Tip** Use Standard tables and columns when possible. Review the list of standard tables before you create a custom table.


## Working with Solutions

### Types of Solutions

**Managed Solution**
The solution is moving to a test or production environment.

**Unmanaged Solution**
This solution is moving to another environment or to source control. 
Choose this if you are sharing with another developer who can use it in their development environment.

### Exporting and Importing Solutions

To export, click on the **Export** link in the **Solutions** section. When you export a solution, it will be downloaded as a zip file.

To import, click on the **Import** link in the **Solutions** section. Use **Browse** to locate your solution zip file and then click **Import**.

### Moving Solutions Between Evnironments
It is possible to setup pipelines to automate the process of moving solutions between environments. The easiest way to do this is to use **Pipelines for Power Platform**.

## Gateways
Configure access to data that is not in the Dataverse.
